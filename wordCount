The Super Mario games are set primarily in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom, typically with Mario as the player character. 
He is usually joined by his brother, Luigi, and often by other members of the Mario cast. As platform games, they involve the player character running and jumping across platforms and 
atop enemies in themed levels. The games have simple plots, typically with Mario and Luigi rescuing the kidnapped Princess Peach from the primary antagonist, Bowser. 
The first game in the series, Super Mario Bros., released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985, established the series' core gameplay concepts and elements. 
These include a multitude of power-ups and items that give the character special powers such as fireball-throwing and size-changing.
